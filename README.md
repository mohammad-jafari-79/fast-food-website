## Why did I choose this topic for the project?
Websites provide the presence of any person, group, company and etc, in the Internet world.</br>
Having a website is like having a store that has no time and place restrictions and is available to the whole world.</br>
The online presence of a business in the web world outside of that type of business will have a great impact on its success.</br>
Nowadays, many of your customers visit your website before making a purchase.</br>
Having a quality online presence can increase your income.</br>
As for traditional and office businesses, the most important thing is to choose the right place for the sales office, and the busier the neighborhood is, the more likely it is to attract customers.</br>
The same thing is true for the internet business, if this business does not meet the necessary standards for creating a website or page, it will fail in its business.</br>
In today's world, the surest way to overcome these limitations is to offer the product through the website.</br>
After launching your website, you will have the possibility to attract customers from anywhere in the world without boundaries and to expand your circle of customers from any geographical boundaries.</br>
Considering the reasons mentioned and the importance of the website in the discussion of selling products, I planned to have experience in this field by implementing a store website.
